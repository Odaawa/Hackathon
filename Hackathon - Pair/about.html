Mathway might be the only calculator you need...for everything. It covers all the following areas: basic math, pre-algebra, algebra, trigonometry, precalculus, calculus, statistics, finite math, linear algebra, chemistry, and graphing.

It's free to see answers, define terms, and plot points on a graph, but if you want step-by-step work and detailed explanations, you'll have to subscribe to the Premium version.

The Mathway calculator app is chock-full of functions for several areas of math, so it's great that each category has its own section, like one for basic math and another for linear algebra. It gets confusing if multiple areas are mixed into one big calculator like how some calculator apps work.

The app keeps a history of each section in the respective categories, so you can always return to Trigonometry, for example, to see those problems and answers even after you open a different area of the app.

The only exception is that there isn't a history of previous graphing problems. In fact, if you begin a graphing problem but don't plot it, and then move to some other category, you'll lose that progress.
