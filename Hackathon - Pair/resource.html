Figuring the tip amount at a restaurant, barber, casino, etc., needs to be a quick process that makes sense. The Tip Calculator app makes this easy.

What makes this app stand out among some of the other tip calculators is that you can drag the Tip % option left and right to see, in real time, how it affects the total bill amount.

After you enter the total amount of the bill, can see the tip amount and total price immediately. To refine what you'll pay, adjust the tip percentage option and choose how many people the bill is for (you can pick 1â€“30).

The rounding option will round the total bill amount up or down to the closest dollar amount, whichever direction you choose.

This calculator app is free with ads, but you can get the Pro version (here for Android or here for iOS) for $2.99 USD to remove ads.
